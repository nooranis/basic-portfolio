	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<img src="#" alt="picture" />
	<p>I lost my parents at the age of six. We were traveling from London to visit family in America. I remember being especially excited. I loved a television show called LampChop and we were going to the country were she lives! I decided I would stay up for the whole plane ride to memorize every question I had for her. My mother told me how long the trip would be while she packed away all of my little summer dresses into one of the many suitecases. It seemed like easily a hundred suitecases were packed for this trip, I was told there were so many because we were going to spend the entire summer in America.</p>
	<p>On the morning we left London, my mother let me choose my dress for the flight. I remember picking the pale yellow dress with faint blue and purple flowers, it was my favorite. </p>
